It would certainly appear that Io is strongly typed as a type error was thrown when doing 1 + "one".

Io> true and 0
==> true
Io> true and nil
==> false
Io> true and ""
==> true

Io> Car := Object clone
==>  Car_0x271a70:
type             = "Car"

Io> Car description := "Vehicle"
==> Vehicle
Io> SportsCar := Car clone
==>  SportsCar_0x288740:
type             = "SportsCar"

Io> SportsCar color := "red"
==> red
Io> Car slotNames
==> list(description, type)
Io> SportsCar slotNames
==> list(type, color)
Io> SportsCar proto slotNames
==> list(description, type)

= assigns a new value to an existing slot
:= will create a slot if it doesn't already exist and then assign to it
::= creates accessor methods <name> and set<Name> so you can call Thing.setValue("test") and Thing.value => "test"
